# respublica-bot

This is a bot that fills in my daily covid-19 form (cause i'm too lazy to do it myself everyday) :see_no_evil:

So the bot logs into my respublica portal and answers "NO" to all the COVID-19 questions

In the event that I feel a symptom change, I'll manually log in and answer "YES" to the relevant question (I promise)

Instructions on how to deploy the bot onto a Heroku server are listed in the beginning of 'respublica.py'
